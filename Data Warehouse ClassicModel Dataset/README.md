    * classic_cars_current.csv: This file contains current classic car inventory data.
* **Excel files:** The Excel files will be accessed using the Talend Open Studio Excel component. The data will be extracted from the following files:
    * classic_cars_inventory.xlsx: This file contains current classic car inventory data.

### Specific Data Cleaning and Transformation Requirements:**

The data will be cleaned and transformed using the following Talend Open Studio components:

* **Data quality checks:** The data will be checked for errors and inconsistencies using the Talend Open Studio Data Quality component.
* **Data type conversions:** The data types of the columns will be converted to a common format using the Talend Open Studio Type Conversion component.
* **Data normalization:** The data will be normalized to a common scale using the Talend Open Studio Normalize component.

### Specific Data Warehouse Requirements:**

The data warehouse will be hosted on a cloud-based database platform. The data will be loaded into the data warehouse using the Talend Open Studio Database component.

### Specific Dashboard Requirements:**

A dashboard will be created using the following tools:

* **Talend Open Studio:** The dashboard will be built using the Talend Open Studio Reporting component.
* **Matplotlib:** The dashboard will use Matplotlib to create charts and graphs.

The dashboard will visualize the following insights:
